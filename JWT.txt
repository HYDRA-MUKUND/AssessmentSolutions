
JWT is a standerd to share the information between two entities(Client and Server)
JSON Web Tokens are used to identify an authenticated user, they are issued by
the server when the user is authenticated for the first time. 

The structure of JWT
 : JWT contains three parts
    1. Header
       : This is the algorithm that we select to encrypt the information
         stored in token.
    2. Payload
       : This stores the claim information that is used to anytime identify 
         the claim.
    3. Signature
       : This is the unique Id generated to validate the authorize user to 
         provide the access.

Benefits of JWT 
 : 1. It is highly secured mechanism to protect the Web Api from an unauthorized
      access.
   2. Saves the database space as it is stored on the client only.
   3. JWT is stateless as the user state is never saved in database, so 
      it doesnâ€™t require a database lookup.
